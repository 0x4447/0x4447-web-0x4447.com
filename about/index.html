				<h1>About 0x4447™</h1>

				<p>0x4447 was created out of necessity when I realized that my many years of experience had brought me to a point where I was ready to pass on my knowledge and know-how to others who sought information. With 0x4447, my goal is to create a place where people feel safe enough to make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and improve. This is the same way I did it, but the difference is that I’ll be there to help others when they fail and provide them with a better and more meaningful understanding of their mistakes.</p>

				<p>For whatever reason, failure is seen as a weakness and something to be avoided. But in reality, experiencing failure is the only way we humans can learn and become better people.</p>

				<p>The urge to test, experiment, and explore our curiosity is a built-in human trait, but the older generations created schools that forcibly removed this innate curiosity and wonder. I always fought back against the grown-ups, and I'm thankful that I kept my natural curiosity intact. Now I want to help bring that curiosity back out in other people.</p>
