          different
          capacities at a range of companies. That work included numerous projects, products, and more. Through
          it all, we
          learned how to bring out the best in people and how to organize and manage a project by building a
          solid foundation
          that allows for easy expansion, maintenance, and adaptation to the changing times.</p>
